How can they still be together?” And I think a lot people ask these questions. And so I built this platform game that represents the passion and hardship that a couple in a relationship would. Using two circles that’s tied together with a string, a string which represents the intimate love and connection, you will have to go through puzzling obstacles and assure that the two circles are still connected together. Sometimes, you have to disconnect the string because the circles have to go through different paths. But someday, the two will always get together again. This game symbolizes how love can build each other and create synergy.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
